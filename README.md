<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Title:  Notification App

## Description:
The Beginner's Notification App is a simple web application designed to help beginners understand how to interact with a JSON Placeholder API using TypeScript. This app allows users to add and delete notifications from a remote server and displays them in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Add Notification: Users can add new notifications by providing a title for the notification. Upon submission, the notification is added to the remote JSON Placeholder API.

- Delete Notification: Users can delete existing notifications by clicking on a delete button associated with each notification displayed in the interface. Upon deletion, the notification is removed from both the interface and the remote JSON Placeholder API.

- Display Notifications: The app displays notifications retrieved from the JSON Placeholder API in a list format. Each notification is displayed with its title and a delete button for easy interaction.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, TypeScript

**Server:** JSON Placeholder API


## Purpose

The purpose of the Beginner's Notification App is to provide beginners with a hands-on learning experience in building a simple web application using React, TypeScript, and RESTful APIs. By following along with the app's development and interacting with the codebase, beginners can gain valuable insights into modern web development practices and strengthen their skills in frontend development.

## Target Audience

The Beginner's Notification App is designed for beginners who are new to web development and looking to gain practical experience in building web applications. It assumes basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but no prior experience with React, TypeScript, or RESTful APIs is required.
